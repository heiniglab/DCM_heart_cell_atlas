This scripts summarize how we used edgeR to compute differentially expressed genes. 

Explanation of columns:
- logFC	logCPM	F	PValue	FDR: This is returned by edgeR 
- low_expression: this genes per cell-state/type show low mean expression in both pathogenic variant and control
- FDR_plot: -log10(FDR)
- mean_exp_control: Mean expression in control group
- mean_exp_genotype: Mean expression in pathogenic variant group
- Region: Which region was tested
- annotation_level: Comparison of cell-type or state
- cell_state/_type: Which cell-state/-type was tested
- comparison: Which genotype was compared to control
- Observations_genotype: How many samples of one pathogenic variant group fullfill minimum requirements (e.g. minimum cell-state count)
- Observations_reference: How many samples of the control group fullfill minimum requirements (e.g. minimum cell-state count)
