Here are the settings for preprocessing/alignment. For the alignment, **cellranger 3.0.0, Ens93 and GRCh38** have been used. 2 runs surpassed 300.000 reads 
per nucleus and have been downsampled to 100.000 reads/nucleus (molecule_info.h5 file). Please check Sample_Table.txt for further information.
